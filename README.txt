BUNNY-JUMP-GAME

This is my first game that I have made using ES6 along with Phaser.io 2D game framework.The game is a simple infinite 
carrot collector BUNNY that jumps on platforms using left and right arrow keys.I have also added the jumping effect along 
with the sound when buny jumps.The game has two scenes first in game.js file which has the normal working game where BUNNY
collects the carrots and the second is gameOver.js where the bunny missed the last platform and the game is over. the player 
can restart the game by pressing the spacebar key.
I am learning more of the Phase.io framework and will be back with a more intriguing game. Till then Peace out.
